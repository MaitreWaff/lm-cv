summary: With over 10 years of experience in IT, I bring a solid background in systems infrastructure (Linux, virtualization, storage, networking), automation, application development, no-code tools, and artificial intelligence. Naturally curious and highly driven, I’ve developed a strong passion for cybersecurity, with a particular focus on Red Team operations such as penetration testing and offensive security assessments. My hybrid profile—blending deep technical expertise with a strategic understanding of complex systems—allows me to uncover vulnerabilities, design secure architectures, and automate robust environments at scale. I’m actively seeking to join a forward-thinking Red Team where I can contribute to identifying critical weaknesses, stress-testing systems, and enhancing cybersecurity posture through proactive offensive measures.
